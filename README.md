# react-express-todo-app

### How to run the project

The project has 2 folders: client and server <br>
client folder contains the frontend which is built with <b>create-react-app</b> <br>
server folder contains some backend code written in <b>express.js</b> <br>

install all the packages for client folder by moving to the folder and running <code>npm install</code> <br>
install all the packages for server folder by moving to the folder and running <code>npm install</code> <br>

<i>you must run servers for frontend and backend separately to ensure app works</i><br>
in the client folder, run the command <code>npm start</code> to start the dev server <br>
in the server folder, run the command <code>npm run dev</code> to start the server <br>

and the app is running!
